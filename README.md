This project is the first of a series of example projects using ReactJS. The overall plan is to develop each of the example project found in [this article](https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/) (which I do not own).

Its purpose is to track my progress into getting used to properly develop using ReactJS.

## Social-Card

Social Card is a React component displaying a card item for a fake social network.
